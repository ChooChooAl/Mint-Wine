This folder contains only the 64x64 or @2.png images.
Making it easier to change color/images since it's only necessary to change the one size 64x64 size.
The scale32.sh script will then copy all @2.png images to the folder above along with scaling it down to 32x32.

The GIMP xcf file is used to build the images in this folder.
